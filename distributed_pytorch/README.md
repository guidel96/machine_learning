Project submissione for the ULB course: INFO-H515 - Big Data : Distributed Data Management and Scalable Analytics - 202021   

Goals:  
- classification: use PyTorch to train a Neural Net to recognise plants (Herbarium dataset from Kaggle)  
- Train the neural net(s) in a distributed fashion, using MPI  

Notes:  
Accuracy should be neglected, it's very poor because no access to the ULB cluster and laptop couldn't store the dataset so I only trained on 100 images to test the code.
